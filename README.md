# Royale with Cheese
Mid-Course project for Craft Academy October 2017 Cohort.

## Description
Royale with Cheese is an app to search movies by a specific genre.
This was our first approach with APIs, we connected to
https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api to get the results we wanted.
We also made our first user authentication process with Devise and implemented orders and order summary page.
